      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>There is a project I have but I think it would be too big for this class. I'm not sure. <br>
        I would like to create my own database with maybe 100 children in it, with their picture, their information,
        etc. People who are registered and have sponsored 1 or more children would be able to access the information on
        the child(ren) they sponsor. <br>
        Someone with a manager account would be able to modify the information and add new pictures or text. <br>
        I only did the Introduction to Database, so I'm really not sure how I could do that. For the purpose of this
        class I know I could populate this database with at least 30 children, but don't know how to connect it with a
        website or anything. All I know is how to use data from an API. <br>
        I also have no idea how to use LocalStorage yet.</p>
